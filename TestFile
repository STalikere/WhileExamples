A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation,
program execution, and printing text.
Shell scripts have several required constructs that tell the shell environment what to do and when to do it. Of course,
most scripts are more complex than the above one.

The shell is, after all, a real programming language, complete with variables, control structures, and so forth. No matter how 
complicated a script gets, it is still just a list of commands executed sequentially.

The following script uses the read command which takes the input from the keyboard and assigns it as the value of the 
variable PERSON and finally prints it on STDOUT.
The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user.

The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is 
called the operating system or the kernel.

Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter; it translates 
commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.
